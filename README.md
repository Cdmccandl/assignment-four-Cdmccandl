Assignment 2:
added validations to each model. assumed that length for each should be less than 2
and value presence should be true.

added search bars to each view by creating a search function in each controller
and calling this seach function in the view index for each model.

still working on testing and fixing odd bugs, (car create doesnt work, part destroy doesnt work)
