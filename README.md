Conor McCandless Assignment 5:

After looking through Dr. Beatys github repository I chose to implement the jQuery
Spa as it looked interesting to me. After adding all of the required javascript to the public
folder I changed all of the required inputs for each of the 3 tables in my application.
I had to collaborate with warren and michael to fix the json builder in cars to recognize multiple Parts
Overall I thought this was a very interesting assignment and given more time I believe I could add a lot more
to this application to make it more visually appealing. 

What I learned:
How a single page application is implemented and how the json data is communicated dynamically through the clients browser
without the need for multiple queries to the database.
